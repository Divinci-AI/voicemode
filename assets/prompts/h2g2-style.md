# Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Style Prompts

## Rod Lord Glass Plate Style (1981 BBC TV Series)

### Main H2G2 Voice Mode Prompt
```
A retro vector computer graphic in the style of the 1981 BBC Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy TV series, created using back-lit photographic lith film on glass plates. Hand-drawn on illuminated glass with sharp, luminous edges and clean glowing lines with absolutely no texture or digital artifacts. Pure black background with vector outlines only.

The image shows a technical diagram explaining "Voice Mode" software in the Guide's signature style. Simple geometric shapes and angular line art only - no curves, no gradients, no shading. Phosphor green dominant with occasional red, yellow, cyan accents.

Include labeled sections with arrows and monospace uppercase text:
- "VOCAL PATTERN BUFFER" (simplified larynx diagram)
- "CLAUDE INTERFACE MODULE" (geometric brain with antenna)
- "MCP PROTOCOL CONVERTER" (box with connecting lines)
- "AUDIO WAVEFORM MATRIX" (simple oscilloscope pattern)

Text labels in phosphor green or cyan:
"VOICE MODE: MOSTLY HARMLESS"
"WARNING: MAY CAUSE SPONTANEOUS CONVERSATIONS WITH AI"
"BABEL FISH NOT INCLUDED"

Style exactly mimics Rod Lord's back-lit glass plate animation technique - ultra-clean vector lines that appear to glow from within, as if light is shining through film on glass. Absolutely minimal, no textures, pure line art as if drawn with light itself.

## Key Style Elements
- **Technique**: Back-lit photographic lith film on glass plates
- **Colors**: Phosphor green (#00FF00) primary, occasional red/yellow/cyan
- **Background**: Pure black (#000000)
- **Lines**: Sharp, luminous, glowing from within
- **Shapes**: Angular, geometric, no curves
- **Text**: Monospace, uppercase, IBM typewriter style
- **No**: Textures, gradients, fills, modern effects

## Tips for Better Results
1. Emphasize "no texture" and "no digital artifacts"
2. Mention "hand-drawn" to avoid over-rendered look
3. Use "vector outline only" for cleaner results
4. Add "technical diagram" or "schematic" for appropriate style
5. Include "1981" to avoid modern interpretations
