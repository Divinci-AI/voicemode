# Modern Minimal Style Prompts

## Clean Technical Aesthetic

### Minimal Logo Design
```
Minimalist logo design for "Voice Mode". Simple geometric shapes, single line weight. Monochromatic or two-color maximum. Abstract representation of sound waves or voice. Clean, modern, technical aesthetic. White background, vector style, no gradients.
```

### Technical Diagram Style
```
Clean technical diagram showing voice processing flow. Minimal line art, geometric shapes connected by arrows. Modern sans-serif labels. Two-color scheme (black and accent color). White background, plenty of negative space. Swiss design influence.
```

## Dark Mode Variations

### Dark Minimal Interface
```
Dark mode UI design for voice software. Pure black background (#000000), thin white lines. Minimal geometric elements suggesting audio waveform. Subtle neon accent (cyan or green). Ultra-clean, no textures, modern technical aesthetic.
```

### Glassmorphism Audio
```
Glassmorphic design element for audio interface. Translucent panels with subtle blur, thin borders. Dark background with soft glow effects. Minimal audio waveform visualization. Modern, elegant, technical.
```

## Abstract Voice Representations

### Sound Wave Abstract
```
Abstract representation of voice as geometric art. Concentric circles or angular waves. Limited color palette (2-3 colors max). Clean vector style, mathematical precision. Modern data visualization aesthetic.
```

### Voice Pattern Grid
```
Minimalist grid pattern representing voice modulation. Dots or lines forming wave patterns. Monochromatic with single accent color. Clean, rhythmic, technical. Inspired by audio spectrum analyzers.
```

## Icon Sets

### Voice Mode Icons
```
Set of minimal icons for voice interface. 24x24 pixel grid, single line weight. Topics: microphone, waveform, speaker, AI brain. Monochromatic, perfect circles and 45-degree angles only. Modern technical icon style.

## Key Principles
- **Less is more**: Remove everything non-essential
- **Geometric**: Use basic shapes and mathematical forms
- **Monochromatic**: Primarily single color or grayscale
- **Space**: Embrace negative space
- **Technical**: Clean, precise, engineered aesthetic
