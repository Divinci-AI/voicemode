# Audio Visualization Style Prompts

## Waveform Visualizations

### Classic Waveform
```
Audio waveform visualization on black background. Bright green oscilloscope-style wave pattern. Horizontal time axis, vertical amplitude. Clean vector lines, no fill. Technical measurement grid in background. Professional audio software aesthetic.
```

### 3D Waveform
```
Three-dimensional audio waveform visualization. Isometric perspective, waves extruded in Z-axis. Gradient from cyan to magenta based on frequency. Black background, subtle grid floor. Modern audio analysis software style.
```

## Spectrum Analysis

### Frequency Spectrum
```
Real-time frequency spectrum analyzer display. Vertical bars showing frequency bins, colors indicating amplitude (blue-green-yellow-red). Black background, frequency labels on X-axis, dB scale on Y-axis. Professional audio engineering interface.
```

### Circular Spectrum
```
Circular audio spectrum visualizer. Radial frequency bars emanating from center. Phosphor green on black, slight glow effect. Concentric circles for amplitude reference. Futuristic audio interface design.
```

## Voice Pattern Visualization

### Voiceprint Spectrogram
```
Human voice spectrogram visualization. Time on X-axis, frequency on Y-axis, intensity as color. Heat map style (black-blue-cyan-yellow-white). Visible formants and harmonics. Scientific audio analysis aesthetic.
```

### Voice Recognition Pattern
```
Abstract visualization of voice recognition process. Flowing lines representing speech patterns transforming into text. Particle effects showing AI processing. Dark background with cyan/green highlights. Modern AI interface aesthetic.
```

## Abstract Audio Art

### Sound Particle System
```
Particle system visualization of sound. Thousands of small dots forming wave patterns in 3D space. Particles colored by frequency, moving based on amplitude. Black background, subtle motion blur. Modern generative art style.
```

### Audio DNA Helix
```
DNA double helix structure made from audio waveforms. Spiraling sound waves in 3D space. Phosphor green with rainbow frequency highlights. Black background, technical yet organic. Representing voice as genetic code.
```

## Key Elements
- **Colors**: Phosphor green, cyan, spectrum gradients
- **Background**: Usually black for contrast
- **Movement**: Suggest motion even in static images
- **Technical**: Include measurement grids, scales, labels
- **Data**: Make it look like real audio analysis
