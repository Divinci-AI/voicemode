You goal is to identify why voice-mcp is producing sound when claude code is run without "--debug --debug-mcp" and fix the problem.
The main purpose of this project is mcp-servers/voice-mcp                                    │
We wrote this last week and I open sourced it. I have discovered it has this serious flaw that means it won't work for people if they install it.                                              │
It doesn't have automated testing and I'm not sure of the best ways to test it.              │
We've detected a problem with it - when I run claude code without the --debug and            │
--debug-mcp options I do not hear any audio when you call the voice-mcp functions to speak.  │
│                                                                                                │
- livekit is not available currently, so we are just using the microphone and speaker with   │
the OpenAI for ASR and TTS.      
please work out how we can create automated tests for mcp-servers/voice-mcp
search the web, inspect the code and close the loop by writing and running automated tests
Please document useful information you find in ai_docs.
