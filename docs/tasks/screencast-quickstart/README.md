# 2-Minute Quickstart Screencast Task Breakdown

## The One Thing
Create a compelling 2-minute quickstart video that gets developers excited about voice-mode.

## Resources
- [Recording Runbook](./runbook.md) - OBS setup and recording steps
- [Script/Outline](../screencasts/00-quickstart-2min.md) - Original 2-minute video outline

## Must-Have Tasks (Critical Path)

### Pre-Production
- [ ] Ensure voice-mode is working smoothly end-to-end
- [ ] Prepare demo environment (clean terminal, proper lighting)
- [ ] Have screencast script/outline ready

### Recording
- [ ] Record the 2-minute screencast following the outline
- [ ] Capture high-quality audio

### Post-Production
- [ ] Basic editing (trim dead air, remove mistakes)
- [ ] Add captions if time permits
- [ ] Export in appropriate format

## Nice-to-Have (Can Be Done Later)
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Fix minor bugs not visible in demo
- [ ] Advanced editing effects
- [ ] Multiple format exports

## Ideas to Park
_Add any ideas that come up but aren't critical for the first screencast_
- Move runbook to permanent location after screencast is complete
- Create docs/runbooks/ directory for operational procedures
- Add MCP server for screen sharing/screenshots to help with visual tasks
- Move saved audio files to XDG standard location (~/.local/share/voicemode/audio)

## Notes
- Focus on showing the magic, not perfection
- Better to ship something than wait for perfect
- Can always make an improved version later
