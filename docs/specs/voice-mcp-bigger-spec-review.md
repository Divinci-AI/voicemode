## 🔴 High Priority Copies

### 1. Docker Compose Specification
- **Source**: `docker-compose/spec.md`
- **Target**: `docs/docker/docker-compose-guide.md`
- **What**: Complete multi-service Docker deployment configuration
- **Why Critical**: Current voicemode lacks comprehensive Docker support despite being a complex multi-service application
- **Key Features**:
  - Complete Docker Compose configuration for all services
  - Health checks and dependency management
  - GPU/CPU optimization options
  - Production deployment guidelines

### 2. Kokoro Integration Suite
- **Source**: `kokoro-integration/` (4 files)
- **Target**: `docs/kokoro/` directory
- **Why Critical**: Current Kokoro documentation is minimal
- **Files to Copy**:
  - `integration-spec.md` - Architecture and design decisions
  - `implementation-plan.md` - Ready-to-use scripts and code
  - `configuration-guide.md` - Provider selection and fallback logic
  - `browser-compatibility.md` - Known issues and workarounds

## 🟡 Medium Priority Copies

### 3. Voice MCP SaaS (Selective Adaptation)
- **Extract Valuable Features**:
  - Claude web integration concept
  - Voice quality and audio processing patterns
  - Developer experience examples
- **Transform Requirements**:
  - Remove all enterprise/SaaS/pricing references
  - Focus on self-hosted capabilities
  - Adapt to current OSS architecture
- **Proposed Files**:
  - `CLAUDE-WEB-INTEGRATION.md` → `docs/features/claude-web-extension.md`
  - Audio concepts from `PHONE-INTEGRATION.md` → `docs/architecture/voice-quality.md`

### 4. Core Voice MCP Specs (Historical Context)
- **Value**: Architecture evolution and design rationale
- **Content to Preserve**:
  - Original vision and goals
  - Architectural decisions and patterns
  - Problem-solving journey (dual-agent conflicts)
  - Design principles that remain relevant
- **Proposed Structure**:
  - `docs/architecture/history.md` - Evolution from original vision
  - `docs/architecture/design-decisions.md` - Key architectural choices

### 5. Whisper Integration (Advanced Reference)
- **Source**: `whisper-integration/` (2 files)
- **Target**: `docs/whisper-advanced/`
- **Purpose**: Advanced optimization and container approaches
- **Note**: Add disclaimer that current implementation uses simpler approach
- **Value**:
  - Hardware optimization guidance
  - Model selection recommendations
  - Performance benchmarks
  - Container deployment options

### 6. Standalone Specs
- **Files**:
  - `README.md` → `docs/specs/README.md` (adapted for voicemode)
  - `streaming-http-mcp.md` → `docs/specs/streaming-mcp-concept.md`
- **Value**:
  - Architecture overview applicable to current stack
  - Future enhancement patterns for streaming interactions

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate (High Priority)
1. Copy Docker Compose specification
2. Copy all Kokoro integration documentation
3. Create directory structure

### Phase 2: This Week (Medium Priority)
1. Adapt SaaS specs for OSS features
2. Extract and condense historical context
3. Add advanced Whisper documentation

### Phase 3: As Needed
1. Implement Claude web extension based on specs
2. Consider streaming MCP pattern for future versions
3. Update specs based on implementation experience

## 💡 Expected Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - One-command Docker deployment
   - Comprehensive local TTS guidance
   - Clear troubleshooting documentation

2. **Developer Benefits**
   - Historical context for design decisions
   - Advanced optimization options
   - Future enhancement roadmap

3. **Project Growth**
   - Lower barrier to entry
   - Better documentation coverage
   - Foundation for new features

## 📝 Notes

- All copied files should include headers noting their origin
- SaaS-focused content requires significant adaptation
- Priority on practical, immediately useful documentation
- Preserve valuable technical insights while removing outdated implementation details

## 🚀 Quick Copy Commands

For Phase 1 (High Priority), from the voicemode repo root:

```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p docs/docker docs/kokoro

# Copy Docker Compose spec
cp ../voice-mcp-bigger/docs/specs/docker-compose/spec.md docs/docker/docker-compose-guide.md

# Copy Kokoro integration suite
cp ../voice-mcp-bigger/docs/specs/kokoro-integration/*.md docs/kokoro/
```

For Phase 2 (Medium Priority):

```bash
# Create additional directories
mkdir -p docs/architecture docs/features docs/whisper-advanced

# Copy Whisper specs
cp ../voice-mcp-bigger/docs/specs/whisper-integration/*.md docs/whisper-advanced/

# Note: Other Phase 2 files require manual adaptation, not direct copying
```
