# WireGuard Comparison

## One-liner for getting attention

I don't want VoiceMode to be like WireGuard - brilliant tech that took years to get noticed because the creator couldn't get anyone to actually try it. Three weeks in with 50 stars, but this changes how we talk to AI - please give it a real shot.

## Context

This snippet draws a parallel between VoiceMode and WireGuard's early days. Jason Donenfeld spent about two years trying to convince people to try WireGuard before it gained traction. The message emphasizes the importance of people actually trying the technology rather than just reading about it.

## Usage

- For reaching out to influencers/YouTubers who've noticed but haven't tried VoiceMode
- When explaining the urgency of early adoption
- To create FOMO about missing out on transformative technology
