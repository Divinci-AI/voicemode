## Voice Duration Guidelines

When using voice tools, ALWAYS set appropriate duration parameters based on expected response length:

### For `ask_voice_question`:
- Simple yes/no questions: use `duration=10` 
- Normal conversational responses: use `duration=20` (better than default 15)
- Open-ended questions: use `duration=30`
- Questions expecting detailed explanations: use `duration=45`
- Questions about stories or long explanations: use `duration=60`

### For `listen_for_speech`:
- Single words/commands: use `duration=5`
- Normal sentences: use `duration=10`
- Multiple sentences: use `duration=20`
- Long dictation: use `duration=30-60`

**IMPORTANT**: Always err on the side of longer duration. It's better to have silence at the end than to cut off the user mid-sentence.

## Voice Parameter Selection Guidelines

When using voice tools (`converse`, `ask_voice_question`), DO NOT specify voice, model, or provider parameters unless:
- The user explicitly requests a specific voice/model/provider
- You need specific features (e.g., emotional TTS requires gpt-4o-mini-tts model)
- You're testing failover by trying a different provider after a failure
- You're debugging a specific configuration issue
